## Setup

1) Create a Spotify app: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2) Add Redirect URIs (2025 rules):
   - Dev: `http://127.0.0.1/` (no port, supports dynamic ports)
   - Prod (GitHub Pages): `https://belisario-afk.github.io/spoti/`
3) Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and set your Client ID.

## Notes

- Premium is required for in-browser playback.
- Due to DRM, visuals use metadata (tempo/energy) + album colors, not raw audio.
- If images block cross-origin, palette may fall back; visuals still run.

## Troubleshooting

- Redirect mismatch: ensure exact match to your site URL (origin + path + trailing slash).
- Login button does nothing: hard refresh; clear `sp_auth` and `viz_settings_v3`.
- Playback blocked on iOS: tap Play (user gesture required).
- Performance: lower Complexity in Settings or let adaptive quality adjust.
